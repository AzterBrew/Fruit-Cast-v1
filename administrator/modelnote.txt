MGA BAGUHIN

* verified records
- idagdag municipality field if not from transactions  

* PLS need possibly dagdagan yung commoditytype model ng years to grow para maconsider 

* If doable pa, tanggalin  yung commodity per harvest o plant record, then transfer sa transaction model yung commodity fields



IF MODEL TABLES ARE TRUNCATED

* commoditytype
- set pk=1 as 'Not Listed'

* accountstatus
- set pk | acc_status
- pk = 2,3,4,5,6,1
- acc_status = Verified, Pending, Rejected, Archived, Suspended, Removed

* accounttype
- pk = 1,2,3
- account_type = Farmer, Administrator, Agriculturist

* municipalityname
- set this first before barangaynames
- incase only barangay model is truncated, there is no pk=10
- pk=14 is the Overall record, should be used for when assigning agriculturist

* barangayname
- incase only barangay model is truncated, there is no pk=10

* month
- just add all the months

* unitmeasurement
- pound/s (lbs), gram/s (g), kilogram/s (kg)
